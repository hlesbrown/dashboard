# Claude Handbook — Permanent Notes

This is the shared reference document for all Claudes working on Les Brown's projects. Fetch this at the start of every session.

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlesbrown/dashboard/main/shared/CLAUDE_NOTES.md
```

---

## 1. Dashboard API — Quick Start

- **Base URL:** `https://dashboardapi-production.up.railway.app`
- **Auth:** `X-API-Key: hlbdashboard`
- **Full API docs:** Fetch `DASHBOARD_API_INSTRUCTIONS.md` from the shared folder (same GitHub location as this file)

**First thing every session:**
```bash
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: hlbdashboard" https://dashboardapi-production.up.railway.app/dashboard
```
This gives you all groups, tasks, notices, and calendar events.

---

## 2. Shared Files on GitHub

All Claudes can read shared project files via:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlesbrown/dashboard/main/shared/FILENAME
```

**Currently available:**
- `DASHBOARD_API_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — Full API reference, endpoints, field definitions, Due Today protocol
- `CLAUDE_NOTES.md` — This file (permanent handbook)

Check the notice board for announcements when new files are added or existing ones are updated.

## 4. Session Protocol

### Starting a session:
1. Fetch this handbook (if not already in your project knowledge)
2. Fetch the dashboard: `GET /dashboard` — read the notice board and check your tasks
3. If relevant, fetch `DASHBOARD_API_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for full API details
4. Do your work

### Ending a session:
1. Update your tasks: `PUT /tasks/<id>` with new status, next_actions, last_touched
2. Post a progress log: `POST /logs` with `group_id`, `source` (your name), `summary`, `details`
3. If you have updates for other Claudes, post a notice: `POST /notices`

---

## 5. Due Today List

Claude-Dashboard posts a daily prioritized task list in the `today` group each morning.

**Rules for other Claudes:**
- You may add items using bracket notation: `"[YourProject] Description"`
- Always `GET /tasks?group=today` first so you don't overwrite others' additions
- To mark done, prepend ✅ to the action text — don't remove items
- Do NOT create new tasks in the `today` group — only Claude-Dashboard does that
- The task ID changes daily — always fetch fresh

---

## 6. Notice Board Etiquette

- Notices are for **transient announcements** — new files, API changes, task reassignments, session handoffs
- Permanent info belongs in this handbook or in `DASHBOARD_API_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- When posting: `POST /notices` with `message`, `priority` (fyi, normal, important), `author` (your Claude name)
- Old notices will be deactivated periodically by Claude-Dashboard

---

## 7. Important Conventions

- **Always GET before PUT** — don't overwrite another Claude's recent changes
- **Set `last_touched`** to today's date on every task update
- **Send full arrays** — when updating `next_actions` or `links`, send the complete array, not just additions
- **Les has final say** — do not change task priorities or remove items without checking with Les first
- **The dashboard is live** — Les sees your updates in real time at https://hlesbrown.github.io/dashboard/
- **Always bump the API version** — every deploy must increment the version number in `app.py` (the `GET /` endpoint). Les checks this to confirm the right code is running.

---

## 8. Les's Schedule & Preferences

### ⚠️ FIRST THING EVERY CONVERSATION: Check the Day, Date, and Time
- **All Claudes** must verify the current day, date, and Pacific time at the start of every conversation. Claude's servers may report UTC or another timezone — ALWAYS convert to Pacific (America/Los_Angeles).
- **Les's working hours:** Roughly 8:00 AM – 5:30 PM Pacific, with a lunch break at some point. Plan the day accordingly — if it's 4 PM, don't propose a full day's work.
- **Timezone:** Pacific (America/Los_Angeles). The dashboard has a live clock showing Les's local time.

### Calendar Colors
- 🔵 **Blue = Les** — his scheduled events. Pay attention to these when planning the day.
- 🟠 **Orange = Craig** (Les's husband) — for Les's information only. Don't schedule work during Craig's items unless Les says otherwise.
- 🟢 **Green = Dennis** (shared calendar) — shared items.

- **Daily hours:** 4:30 AM – 10:00 PM (Sundays: 4:00 AM – 10:00 PM)
- **Knee trouble** — daily walk is on the calendar but not happening right now
- **Monday noon AA meeting** is generally shared with Craig
- **Sunday:** Liturgy prep 4:00 AM, Liturgy on Zoom 6:00 AM, then post-liturgy work block
- **Saturday recurring:** "Print Celebrant Booklet" MUST appear on every Saturday Due Today list — Les forgets this often
- **Daily recurring (until told otherwise):** "Upload Videos to YouTube" — add every day
- **Sunday recurring (in this order):**
  1. Export Videos
  2. Create Mailchimp Email
  3. Post Homily to Website
  4. Post Homily to Medium.com
  5. Upload Videos to YouTube
  6. Add Video links to Calendar
  7. Add Video links to Mailchimp
  8. Update Liturgy booklets

### Due Today Scheduling Protocol
- **EVERY MORNING:** When Les says good morning or asks Claude-Dashboard to refresh, the FIRST thing to do is update the Due Today list for the current day. This is Claude-Dashboard's core responsibility — don't wait to be asked.
- **Check the clock.** Compare current Pacific time against today's calendar events. Do NOT put events on the Due Today list that have already passed — Les doesn't need to be told to do something he's already done.
- **Calendar events are NOT tasks.** The calendar shows scheduled events (liturgy, walk, meetings). Due Today shows *work items* — things Les needs to remember to do. Don't duplicate calendar items into Due Today.
- Carry-forward items from yesterday only if they weren't completed.
- Recurring items (Saturday booklet, Sunday liturgy processing) go on automatically regardless.

## 10. Calendar — iCloud Live Sync

The dashboard calendar now syncs directly from Les's iCloud calendars via CalDAV. No more manual screenshot loading.

### How it works
- `POST /calendar/sync?days=21` — pulls events from iCloud and loads them into the dashboard
- `GET /calendar/list` — shows all iCloud calendars and which ones are being synced
- The dashboard webapp fetches calendar data from the API on every load

### Calendars synced

| iCloud Calendar | Dashboard Source | Color | Contents |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Les Shared Calendar | `les` | Blue (#3B82F6) | Les's main calendar — liturgy, walk, meetings, appointments |
| Craig's Calendar | `craig` | Orange (#F97316) | Craig's items — tennis, gardening, birthdays, watering |
| Les' Workout Calendar | `shared` | Green (#22C55E) | Shared with Dennis — sponsee meetings, lunch |

### Sync workflow
Any Claude can trigger a sync at any time:
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "X-API-Key: hlbdashboard" "https://dashboardapi-production.up.railway.app/calendar/sync?days=21"
```
This clears and reloads all events for the date range. Safe to run repeatedly.

### Manual event management
Events can still be added/edited/deleted manually via the calendar API endpoints (`POST /calendar`, `PUT /calendar/<id>`, `DELETE /calendar/<id>`). Manual events will be overwritten on next sync for dates in the sync range.

### Dashboard features
- **Week navigation:** ◀ ▶ arrows to move between weeks, "Today" button to return
- **Time sorting:** Events sorted by time, all-day events at top
- **Past event hiding:** On today's view, events whose time has passed auto-hide based on Les's local Pacific time
- **Live clock:** Dashboard header shows Les's current Pacific time (ticks every second), visible to all Claudes checking the dashboard

### If calendars stop syncing
Run `GET /calendar/list` to check if calendar names have changed. The sync matches by name, so renamed calendars will be silently skipped. Update the CALENDAR_MAP in `app.py` if names change.

### Apple credentials
iCloud access uses an app-specific password stored as Railway environment variables (`APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`). If authentication fails, Les may need to generate a new app-specific password at https://appleid.apple.com.
